Decided that this might not provide a good indicator of personal wealth.\r\n\r\nThe [2011 census](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/index.html), [raw data](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/population-and-household-estimates-for-wards-and-output-areas-in-england-and-wales/rft-table-php01-2011-MSOAs-and-LSOAs.zip), gives average personal income within an [MSOA](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/beginner-s-guide/census/super-output-areas--soas-/index.html) (middle layer super output layers; used to aid the reporting of small area statistics, an area containing 5,000 to 15,000 people).\r\n\r\nThe prescription data included the postcode of the practice where it was written.  This was used to map practices to MSOAs using government [postcode data](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/Docs/Lookups/Postcodes_(Enumeration)_(2011)_to_output_areas_(2011)_to_lower_layer_SOA_(2011)_to_middle_layer_SOA_(2011)_to_local_authority_districts_(2011)_E+W_lookup.zip).\r\n\r\n[Per capita income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_capita_income), the mean income per person within an economic unit.\r\n\r\nGoogle map of [spending on prescriptions per capita](http://sandbox.hoonio.com/datahack/) for each MSOA.\r\n\r\nPrescription costs per capita\r\n![alt text](https://github.com/Derek-Jones/Winners-take-All/blob/master/plots/201309_NIC_per_capita.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
